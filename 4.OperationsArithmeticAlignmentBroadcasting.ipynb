    "Here is the complete explanation for Series Operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform an operation like `s1 + s2`, Pandas does something much smarter than a simple element-by-element addition. It first looks at the **index labels** of both Series. This \"lookup\" is called **Index Alignment**. It will only perform an operation (like `+`) between values that share the **same label**. If a label exists in one Series but not the other, the result for that label will be `NaN` (Not a Number). **Broadcasting** is a related, simpler concept where you perform an operation between a Series and a single value (a scalar), and Pandas \"broadcasts\" (repeats) that operation for every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works in Memory**: Operations are **vectorized**, meaning they run on the underlying NumPy arrays at C-level speed, which is extremely fast. When you add two Series, Pandas creates a *new* index in memory that is the **union** (all unique labels) of the two original indexes. It then slots in the results. If an `int` Series has to add a `NaN` (which is a `float`), the *entire* resulting Series will be \"upcast\" to `float64` to hold the `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This**: You use these operations constantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use **Broadcasting** (e.g., `s * 100`) to apply a single change to an entire column, like converting a decimal to a percentage.\n",
    "  * Use **Index Alignment** (e.g., `revenue - costs`) to combine two data sources. This is the core of data analysis, like finding the profit for products, where the alignment feature automatically handles matching the correct 'revenue' and 'cost' for each product label.\n",
    "  * Use **`.add(s2, fill_value=0)`** when you want to combine two Series but want to treat missing items as zero instead of `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0\\. Syntax & Parameters (MUST COME FIRST)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to perform operations: operators (`+`, `-`) and methods (`.add()`, `.sub()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Standard Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "series_1 + series_2  # Addition\n",
    "series_1 - series_2  # Subtraction\n",
    "series_1 * series_2  # Multiplication\n",
    "series_1 / series_2  # Division\n",
    "series_1 ** series_2 # Exponent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **What they do:** These perform the standard math operation *after* aligning the indexes.\n",
    "  * **Result:** You get `NaN` for any label not present in *both* Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Method Equivalents (More Powerful)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "series_1.add(series_2, fill_value=None)\n",
    "series_1.sub(series_2, fill_value=None)\n",
    "series_1.mul(series_2, fill_value=None)\n",
    "series_1.div(series_2, fill_value=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`series_2`**: The \"other\" Series you are combining with.\n",
    "  * **`fill_value`**\n",
    "      * **What it does:** This is the most important parameter. It lets you specify a value (like `0`) to \"substitute\" for any missing labels *during the operation*.\n",
    "      * **Default value:** `None`\n",
    "      * **When you would use it:** You *always* use this when your indexes don't perfectly match, but you want a numeric result instead of `NaN`. For example, `s1.add(s2, fill_value=0)` treats any product that's missing from `s1` as having a value of `0` for the addition.\n",
    "      * **What happens if you don't specify it:** It behaves exactly like the standard operator (e.g., `s1.add(s2)` is the same as `s1 + s2`), resulting in `NaN`s.\n",

    "### 1\\. Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Broadcasting (Series + Scalar)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting is the simplest operation. You combine a Series with a single value, and that operation is \"broadcast\" to every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "\n",
    "# Apply a 10% price increase (Broadcasting)\n",
    "new_prices = prices * 1.10\n",
    "new_prices.name = 'New Prices'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- After 10% Increase ---\")\n",
    "print(new_prices)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- Original Prices ---\n",
    "Apple     1.50\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The scalar value `1.10` was multiplied by every single value in the `prices` Series. The index was preserved perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Simple Arithmetic (Matching Indexes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the ideal scenario, where both Series have the *exact same* index. The operation is a simple, element-by-element match.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is the most important concept to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **'Apple'**: Exists in Store 1 (100) but not Store 2. So, `100 + (missing) = NaN`.\n",

    "**Example 4: Fixing Alignment with `fill_value`**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fix the `NaN` problem from Example 3 by using the `.add()` method and setting `fill_value=0`. This tells Pandas, \"If you can't find a label, just use `0` for the operation.\"\n",

    "**Mistake 6: Forgetting alignment and getting `NaN`s (The Classic)**\n",

    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6\\. Key Terms (Explained Simply)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Index Alignment:** The core Pandas feature. Before any operation, Pandas matches the two Series by their **labels**.\n",
    "  * **Vectorization:** Performing operations on the entire Series at once (not using a `for` loop). This is what makes Pandas fast.\n",
    "  * **Broadcasting:** Performing an operation between a Series (many values) and a scalar (one value). The scalar is applied to every element in the Series.\n",
    "  * **Union (of indexes):** The set of all unique labels from *both* Series combined. The result of an operation will have an index that is the union of the inputs.\n",
    "  * **`NaN` (Not a Number):** The \"missing value\" marker. It appears when alignment fails (a label is in one Series but not the other).\n",
    "  * **`fill_value`**: A parameter to the method-based operations (like `.add()`) that lets you \"fill in\" a default value for missing labels *during* the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7\\. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Be Aware of Indexes:** Always be mindful of what your indexes are. Use `.index` to check.\n",
    "  * **Use `fill_value`:** When combining Series that might not match, *always* use the method version (e.g., `.add()`, `.sub()`) and set a `fill_value` (like `0` or `1`) to avoid `NaN`s.\n",
    "  * **Check `dtype`:** After an operation, check the `dtype` of your result. If it changed from `int64` to `float64`, it's a sign that you created `NaN`s.\n",
    "  * **Broadcasting is Your Friend:** Use broadcasting (`s + 10`) for simple transformations. It's clean, fast, and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8\\. Mini Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Operations between a Series and a scalar (e.g., `s + 10`) are **broadcast** to all elements.\n",
    "  * Operations between two Series (e.g., `s1 + s2`) are **aligned by index** first.\n",
    "  * If labels don't match, the standard `+` operator results in `NaN`.\n",
    "  * To fix this, use the method `.add(s2, fill_value=0)` to substitute `0` for missing values.\n",

    "### 13\\. Common Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **What is \"Index Alignment\" in Pandas?**\n",
    "      * It's the process where Pandas automatically matches data by its **label** before performing an operation.\n",
    "      * If you add two Series, Pandas finds matching labels. 'Q1' is added to 'Q1', 'Q2' to 'Q2', etc.\n",
    "      * The resulting Series has an index that is the *union* of the two original indexes.\n",
    "2.  **I added two Series but my result is full of `NaN`s. Why?**\n",
    "      * This happens because the indexes did not align.\n",
    "      * Either the labels were different (e.g., 'Apple' vs 'apple'), or the labels you expected to match didn't exist in one of the Series.\n",
    "      * The `+` operator produces `NaN` for any label that isn't in *both* Series.\n",
    "3.  **How do you add two Series with different indexes *without* getting `NaN`s?**\n",
    "      * You use the method equivalent, `.add()`, and specify the `fill_value` parameter.\n",
    "      * `s1.add(s2, fill_value=0)` will treat any missing value as `0` for the addition.\n",
    "4.  **What's the difference between `s1 + s2` and `s1.add(s2)`?**\n",
    "      * Functionally, they are identical. *However*, `s1.add(s2)` gives you access to parameters, most importantly `fill_value`, which is what you use to control alignment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14\\. Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Time Complexity:** Operations are vectorized and very fast.\n",
    "      * Broadcasting (Series + scalar) is **O(n)**, where 'n' is the size of the Series.\n",
    "      * Alignment (Series + Series) is roughly **O(n + m)**, where 'n' and 'm' are the sizes of the two Series. Pandas has to first find the union of the indexes.\n",
    "  * **Memory Usage:**\n",
    "      * All operations return a **new Series** (a copy). Your original data is not changed.\n",
    "      * If you add two `int` Series but the alignment creates a `NaN`, the *entire new Series* will be upcast to `float64` to accommodate the `NaN`. This can (briefly) double your memory usage.\n",
    "  * **Vectorization:** This is the *fastest* way to perform operations. Never use a `for` loop to add two Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15\\. When NOT to Use This\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **When you *don't* want alignment.** This is rare. If you have `s1 = [1, 2]` and `s2 = [3, 4]` and you *know* you want the result to be `[4, 6]` regardless of their indexes, you should operate on their underlying NumPy arrays: `pd.Series(s1.values + s2.values)`. This is dangerous and usually a sign of bad data preparation, but it's the alternative.\n",
    "  * **For string concatenation.** While `s1 + s2` *can* work for strings, it's safer and clearer to use the string-specific accessor: `s1.str.cat(s2, fill_value='')`.\n",
    "  * **When `fill_value` is misleading.** If you are calculating an *average* and you use `fill_value=0`, you are artificially dragging the average down. In that case, you may *want* the `NaN` result so you can handle it explicitly (e.g., `.dropna()` or `fill_value=mean`)."
