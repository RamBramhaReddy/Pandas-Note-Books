    "# 8.1 Reindexing, resetting index  `reset_index()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "`df.reset_index()` is one of the most common and useful methods for changing your DataFrame's structure. Its job is to \"demote\" the current index. It takes your *existing* index (whether it's `0,1,2`, names, or dates) and turns it into a *regular data column*. It then replaces it with a simple, new, default integer index (`0, 1, 2, 3...`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essential because many Pandas operations (like `groupby`) *create* a new, complex index. You almost always want to \"reset\" this index to get your data back into a flat, tabular format that's easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works in Memory**: By default (`inplace=False`), `reset_index()` creates a **new** DataFrame. It does this by creating a new `RangeIndex` object for the rows and a new NumPy array (or arrays) for the newly-added column(s) from the old index. The original data blocks are typically *shared* (referenced, not copied), so it's a relatively efficient operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **After a `groupby`**: This is the \\#1 use case. A `groupby().agg()` operation leaves the group keys as the index. `reset_index()` flattens this, turning the group keys into columns.\n",
    "  * **To use the index as data**: If you need to filter, plot, or save a column that is *currently* being used as the index, you must first `reset_index()` to make it a normal column.\n",
    "  * **To clean up a messy index**: If your index is duplicated or confusing after a merge or filter, `reset_index()` gives you a \"fresh start\" with a clean `0, 1, 2...` index.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0\\. Syntax & Parameters (MUST COME FIRST)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataframe.reset_index(level=None, drop=False, inplace=False, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`level`**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **What it does:** In a MultiIndex (a hierarchical index), this tells Pandas *which level* to reset.\n",
    "      * **Default value:** `None`\n",
    "      * **When you would use it:** You use this on a complex DataFrame with multiple index levels (e.g., `index=['Type', 'Date']`) and you only want to reset one of them (e.g., `level='Date'`).\n",
    "      * **What happens if you don't specify it:** It resets *all* levels of the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`drop`**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **What it does:** This is a boolean (True/False). It controls whether the old index is *added as a column* or *thrown away*.\n",
    "      * **Default value:** `False`\n",
    "      * **When you would use it:** You set `drop=True` when you *do not* want to keep the old index values at all. You just want a new `0, 1, 2...` index and want the old one to disappear.\n",
    "      * **What happens if you don't specify it:** The default `False` is used, which means the old index is *kept* and added to your DataFrame as a new column (often named 'index').\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`inplace`**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **What it does:** A boolean (True/False). If `True`, it modifies the original DataFrame *directly* and returns `None`. If `False`, it returns a *new copy* of the DataFrame with the changes.\n",
    "      * **Default value:** `False`\n",
    "      * **When you would use it:** You *can* use `inplace=True` to save memory, but it's **discouraged** as it's less predictable and breaks method chaining. The standard, preferred way is to re-assign: `df = df.reset_index()`.\n",
    "      * **What happens if you don't specify it:** The default `False` is used, which is safer.\n",

    "### 1\\. Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common use. We have a DataFrame with a meaningful index and we want to turn that index into a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Basic `reset_index()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame with a meaningful index\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(\n",
    "    {'Sales': [100, 150, 120]},\n",
    "    index=pd.Index(['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed'], name='Weekday')\n",

    "print(\"\\nNew Columns:\", df_reset.columns)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- Original DataFrame ---\n",
    "         Sales\n",
    "Weekday       \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "See how this worked?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The original index, `Weekday`, was \"demoted\" and became a *regular column*.\n",
    "2.  The `Sales` column was unaffected.\n",
    "3.  A new, default `RangeIndex` (`0, 1, 2`) was created to be the new index.\n",
    "4.  This is a new DataFrame `df_reset`. The original `df` is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2\\. Intermediate Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the power of the `drop=True` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Using `drop=True`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, your index is just the default `0, 1, 2...` but it gets messy after filtering. You don't care about keeping the old index; you just want a *new*, clean one.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Look at the \"Filtered DataFrame\". The index is `0, 2, 3`. This is messy and can cause problems.\n",
    "By using `reset_index(drop=True)`, we did two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Threw away** the old, messy index (`0, 2, 3`).\n",
    "2.  Replaced it with a new, clean `RangeIndex` (`0, 1, 2`).\n",
    "    This is a very common way to clean up a DataFrame after filtering.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Resetting a MultiIndex (Hierarchical Index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"trickiest\" case, but it's also the most powerful. It's what you'll do after a `groupby` with multiple groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is advanced, but shows the `level` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The original `df_multi` has a 2-level index (`Store` and `Dept`).\n",
    "  * `df_multi.reset_index()` (with no parameters) \"flattens\" the whole thing, demoting *both* `Store` and `Dept` into columns.\n",
    "  * `df_multi.reset_index(level='Dept')` *only* demoted the inner `Dept` level, leaving `Store` as the index.\n",

    "### 6\\. Key Terms (Explained Simply)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Index:** The labels for the rows.\n",
    "  * **`RangeIndex`:** The default index in Pandas (`0, 1, 2, 3...`).\n",
    "  * **`MultiIndex`:** A \"hierarchical\" index with multiple levels (like 'Store' *and* 'Dept').\n",
    "  * **Demote:** What `reset_index` does: it turns a \"special\" index label into a \"normal\" data column.\n",
    "  * **Flatten:** The common term for what `reset_index` does to a grouped or MultiIndex DataFrame. It turns it from a nested structure into a flat table.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7\\. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Always `reset_index()` after `groupby()`:** Make this a reflex. `df.groupby(...).agg(...).reset_index()`. This is a *very* common chain.\n",
    "  * **Use `drop=True` after filtering:** If you filter a DataFrame, your index will get gaps. Use `reset_index(drop=True)` to get a new, clean index.\n",
    "  * **Prefer Re-assignment:** `df = df.reset_index()` is safer, more readable, and allows method chaining. Avoid `inplace=True`.\n",
    "  * **Check for name conflicts:** If you have a column *already named* 'index', `reset_index()` will try to add *another* column named 'index', which can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8\\. Mini Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `reset_index()` **demotes** the current index (or index levels) into **data columns**.\n",
    "  * It creates a **new, default `RangeIndex`** (`0, 1, 2...`) in its place.\n",
    "  * Use `drop=True` to **throw away** the old index instead of making it a column.\n",
    "  * The \\#1 use case is to **flatten a DataFrame** after a `groupby()` operation.\n",
    "  * By default, it returns a **new copy**. You must re-assign: `df = df.reset_index()`.\n",

    "### 13\\. Common Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Why do you almost always see `.reset_index()` after a `groupby()`?**\n",
    "      * A `groupby()` operation puts the grouping keys *into the index*. This makes the DataFrame hierarchical and hard to use.\n",
    "      * `reset_index()` \"flattens\" the DataFrame by demoting those keys *out* of the index and back into regular columns, giving you a clean, flat table.\n",
    "2.  **What's the difference between `reset_index()` and `reset_index(drop=True)`?**\n",
    "      * `reset_index()` (default) turns the old index into a **new column** (usually named 'index').\n",
    "      * `reset_index(drop=True)` **throws away** the old index completely. You use this when you just want a new, clean `0, 1, 2...` index and don't care about the old one.\n",
    "3.  **My `df.reset_index()` didn't work. My DataFrame is unchanged. Why?**\n",
    "      * You forgot to re-assign the result. `reset_index()` returns a *new DataFrame* by default (`inplace=False`). You need to do `df = df.reset_index()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14\\. Performance Considerations\n",

    "  * **Time Complexity:** `reset_index()` is generally fast, **O(n)**, where 'n' is the number of rows. It has to create a new `RangeIndex` and one (or more) new arrays for the demoted columns.\n",
    "  * **Memory Usage (Copy vs. View):**\n",
    "      * By default (`inplace=False`), this method returns a **new DataFrame** (a shallow copy).\n",
    "      * It creates a new `Index` object and new `NumPy` arrays for the *new columns* (from the old index).\n",
    "      * It *shares* the memory for all the original data columns. This is very efficient—it's not copying all your data, just creating new \"pointers\" and the new index column.\n",
    "      * `inplace=True` avoids creating a new DataFrame object but still has to create the new column(s) in memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **When your index is meaningful and you want to *keep* it as the index.** If you have a `DatetimeIndex` for a time-series, you almost *never* want to reset it, because all the special time-series methods (like `.resample()`) *depend* on that index.\n",
    "  * **When you actually want to *set* an index.** If you have a column `user_id` and you want to make it the index, you don't use `reset_index()`. You use the opposite: `df.set_index('user_id')`.\n",
    "  * **When `reindex()` is what you need.** If you want to *conform* your DataFrame to a new set of labels (e.g., 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'), `reset_index()` won't do that. You need `.reindex()` for that."
