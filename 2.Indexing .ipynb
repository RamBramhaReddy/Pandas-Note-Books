    "# 2.Indexing\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pandas, **indexing** is just a fancy word for \"selecting\" or \"looking up\" data. Think of your Series as a tall filing cabinet. The **index** is the set of labels on the drawers (`'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`). **Indexing** is the act of pulling open a specific drawer to get the file inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.loc`, `.iloc`, `.at`, and `.iat` are the specific tools Pandas gives you to do this. They let you be precise, telling Pandas *exactly* how you want to find your data: by its **label** (like `loc` or `at`) or by its **position** (like `iloc` or `iat`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works in Memory**: When you use `.loc['A']`, Pandas uses the Series index like a hash map (or a dictionary) to instantly find the memory location associated with the label `'A'`. This is very fast. When you use `.iloc[0]`, Pandas goes directly to the first slot in the underlying NumPy array, which is also instant. `.at` and `.iat` are optimized, stripped-down versions of this for accessing only *one* value, which makes them even faster by skipping some of Pandas's extra safety checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use **`.loc`** when you want to select data using the **index labels** (e.g., `s.loc['Mon']`, `s.loc['Alice']`). This is the most common and intuitive way to select data.\n",
    "  * Use **`.iloc`** when you want to select data using its **integer position** (e.g., `s.iloc[0]` for the 1st item, `s.iloc[5]` for the 6th item), just like a Python list.\n",
    "  * Use **`.at`** as a high-speed replacement for `.loc` when you need to get or set *only one single value* by its **label**.\n",
    "  * Use **`.iat`** as a high-speed replacement for `.iloc` when you need to get or set *only one single value* by its **position**.\n",

    "### 1\\. Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple Series to see `.loc` and `.iloc` in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Basic selection with `.loc` and `.iloc`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Series of student scores\n",

    "\n",
    "# --- .iloc: Select by POSITION ---\n",

    "print(f\"\\n.iloc[1] -> {bob_score_iloc}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    ".loc['Bob'] -> 92\n",
    "\n",
    ".iloc[1] -> 92\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Even though 'Bob' is at position `1`, `.loc` and `.iloc` are used differently. We use `.loc['Bob']` to ask for the value with the *label* 'Bob'. We use `.iloc[1]` to ask for the value at the 2nd *position*. In this case, they return the same value, but they are conceptually different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Using `.at` and `.iat` for the same thing**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "For selecting a single value, `.at` and `.iat` do the same job as `.loc` and `.iloc` but are faster. You can't use them to select multiple items.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is the most critical difference to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`s.loc[2:4]`** selected *labels* 2, 3, and 4. It **includes** the end label (`4`).\n",
    "2.  **`s.iloc[2:4]`** selected *positions* 2 and 3. It **excludes** the end position (`4`). This is standard Python slicing behavior. The items at positions 2 and 3 are `30` (label 3) and `40` (label 4).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "`.loc` slicing works perfectly with text labels, provided the index is sorted (or at least, the slice \"makes sense\"). It selected all items from 'Bob' *up to and including* 'David'. You cannot do this with `.iloc`, which only understands integer positions.\n",

    "### 3\\. Advanced or Tricky Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The most confusing scenario is when a Series has a default integer index (`0, 1, 2, 3...`). Here, the *label* and the *position* are the same, which can be ambiguous.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is why you *must* be explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `s_dropped.iloc[0]` worked fine. It means \"give me the item at the first *position*,\" which is now `'b'`.\n",
    "  * `s_dropped.loc[0]` failed. It means \"give me the item with the *label* `0`.\" Since we dropped that label, Pandas throws a `KeyError`.\n",
    "    This example perfectly shows the real-world difference. `.iloc` is about *order*, `.loc` is about *labels*.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "We used `.loc['Bob']` on the left side of the `=` to assign a new value (`95`) directly to that label. This is far safer and clearer than trying to find the position.

    "### 7\\. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Be Explicit:** Always use `.loc` or `.iloc` for selection. Avoid `series[key]`. Using `[]` alone is ambiguous and can lead to bugs like the one in Example 6.\n",
    "  * **Use `.loc` for Labels:** Even if your index *is* integers (like `[1, 2, 3]`), use `.loc` when you mean to select by that label.\n",
    "  * **Use `.iloc` for Position:** Use `.iloc` when you mean \"get the 1st item\" or \"get the last 5 items,\" regardless of what the labels are.\n",
    "  * **Use `.at`/`.iat` for Speed:** If you need to get or set a *single value* many times (e.g., in a (rare) loop), use `.at` or `.iat`. They are much faster as they skip safety checks.\n",
    "  * **Check Your Index:** Be aware of your index type. If it's integers, be extra careful to know if you're using a *label* (`.loc`) or a *position* (`.iloc`).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8\\. Mini Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`.loc`** = **L**abel. (`s.loc['Alice']`). Slicing is **inclusive** (`.loc['A':'C']` includes 'C').\n",
    "  * **`.iloc`** = **I**nteger **loc**ation (position). (`s.iloc[0]`). Slicing is **exclusive** (`.iloc[0:3]` does *not* include 3).\n",
    "  * **`.at`** = **A**ccess **T**arget (by label). Fast, single-value `.loc`.\n",
    "  * **`.iat`** = **I**nteger **A**ccess **T**arget (by position). Fast, single-value `.iloc`.\n",
    "  * The biggest pitfall is confusing labels and positions, especially on a numeric index.\n",

    "### 13\\. Common Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **What is the main difference between `.loc` and `.iloc`?**\n",
    "      * `.loc` selects data by **label**.\n",
    "      * `.iloc` selects data by **integer position**.\n",
    "      * The key difference is in slicing: `.loc['A':'C']` *includes* 'C', while `.iloc[0:3]` *excludes* 3.\n",
    "2.  **When would you use `.at` instead of `.loc`?**\n",
    "      * You use `.at` when you need to get or set a **single value** and performance is critical. It's much faster than `.loc` for this specific task because it bypasses some of Pandas's internal checks.\n",
    "3.  **What happens if you have an integer index `[0, 1, 3]` and you try to use `s.loc[1]` vs `s.iloc[1]`?**\n",
    "      * `s.loc[1]` will find the item with the *label* `1` and return it.\n",
    "      * `s.iloc[1]` will find the item at the second *position* (which has the label `1`) and return it.\n",
    "      * *Follow-up:* What if you try `s.iloc[2]`? It would return the item at the third *position*, which has the label `3`.\n",
    "      * *Follow-up:* What if you try `s.loc[2]`? It would fail with a `KeyError` because there is no *label* `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14\\. Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "      * `.iloc[i]` and `.iat[i]` are **O(1)** (constant time). They are simple array lookups.\n",
    "      * `.loc['label']` and `.at['label']` are **O(1)** (constant time) on average if the index is a standard hash-based index.\n",
    "      * If the index is sorted, `.loc` can perform a binary search, making it **O(log n)**.\n",
    "      * Slicing (`:`) is generally very fast, often O(k) where k is the slice size.\n",
    "  * **Memory Usage (Copy vs. View):**\n",
    "      * Selecting a single value (`.at`, `.iat`, `.loc[i]`, `.iloc[i]`) returns the value itself (a copy).\n",
    "      * Selecting a *slice* (e.g., `s.iloc[1:5]`) will typically return a **view** of the original Series. This is very memory-efficient as no new data is copied.\n",
    "      * **CRITICAL:** If you modify a view (e.g., `my_view = s.iloc[1:5]; my_view.iloc[0] = 99`), it *may* change the original `s`. Pandas will often warn you about this (`SettingWithCopyWarning`).\n",
    "      * Selecting multiple, non-contiguous items (e.g., `s.iloc[[0, 2, 5]]`) will almost always return a **copy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15\\. When NOT to Use This\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Do not use `[]` for selection.** Avoid `s[0]` or `s['a']`. It's ambiguous and can lead to bugs. `s[0]` might mean \"position 0\" or \"label 0\" depending on the index. `.loc`/`.iloc` remove this ambiguity.\n",
    "  * **Do not use `.at` or `.iat` to select more than one item.** They will fail. They are *only* for single scalar values.\n",
    "  * **Do not use `.loc` to select by position.** It will either fail (if the index is text) or give you the wrong data (if the index is numeric but a label is missing).\n",
    "  * **Do not use `.iloc` to select by label.** It will always fail, as it only accepts integers."
