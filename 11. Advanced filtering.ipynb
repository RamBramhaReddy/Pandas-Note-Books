    "#  11. Advanced filtering  first subtopic: `.query()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.query()` method is a powerful and expressive way to filter a DataFrame. It allows you to select rows by passing a **string** that looks very much like a SQL `WHERE` clause. This can be much cleaner and more readable than standard boolean indexing, especially when you have many conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works in Memory**: Behind the scenes, `.query()` uses a high-performance evaluation engine (by default, the `numexpr` library) to parse the string and apply the filter. This can be *faster* than standard boolean indexing (`df[(df['A'] > 5) & (df['B'] < 10)]`) because it can optimize the full operation at once, rather than creating multiple intermediate boolean Series in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `.query()` when you have **multiple conditions** that are becoming hard to read with `&` and `|`.\n",
    "  * Use it when you want to write **clean, \"English-like\"** filtering logic (e.g., `df.query('Age > 30 and City == \"New York\"')`).\n",
    "  * It's especially powerful for referencing **variables from your code** directly in the query string (e.g., `df.query('Age > @min_age')`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0\\. Syntax & Parameters (MUST COME FIRST)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataframe.query(expr, inplace=False, **kwargs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`expr`** (expression)\n",
    "      * **What it does:** This is a **string** that contains the condition you want to filter on.\n",
    "      * **Default value:** (Required)\n",
    "      * **When you would use it:** You *always* provide this. The string must be a valid boolean expression.\n",
    "          * `df.query('Age > 18')`\n",
    "          * `df.query('Age > 18 and City == \"New York\"')` (Use `and`, `or`, `not` keywords)\n",
    "          * `df.query('`Total Sales`  > 100') ` (Use backticks \\`\\` for column names with spaces)\n",
    "          * `df.query('Age > @min_age')` (Use `@` to reference a Python variable)\n",
    "  * **`inplace`**\n",
    "      * **What it does:** A boolean (True/False). If `True`, it modifies the original DataFrame. If `False`, it returns a *new filtered copy*.\n",
    "      * **Default value:** `False`\n",
    "      * **When you would use it:** It's **strongly recommended** to leave this as `False` and use re-assignment: `df_filtered = df.query(...)`.\n",
    "      * **What happens if you don't specify it:** The default `False` is used, which is safer.\n",

    "})\n",
    "print(\"--- 1. Original DataFrame ---\")\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: A simple query\n",
    "# Note: The string 'Age > 28' is the expression\n",
    "df_filtered = df.query('Age > 28')\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- 2. Filtered DataFrame (df.query('Age > 28')) ---\")\n",
    "print(df_filtered)\n",

    "1    Bob   30  Los Angeles\n",
    "3  David   35      Chicago\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "We passed the string `'Age > 28'` to the `.query()` method. Pandas evaluated this string in the \"context\" of the DataFrame, as if 'Age' was a variable. It returned a new DataFrame containing only the rows (1 and 3) where this expression was `True`.\n",

    "0  Alice   25  New York\n",
    "2  Clara   22  New York\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is much more readable than `df[(df['Age'] > 20) & (df['City'] == 'New York')]`. We just wrote the logic in a simple string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Multiple conditions with `or`**\n",
    "Find all people who are older than 30 *OR* live in New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You can also use the 'or' keyword\n",
    "query_or = 'Age > 30 or City == \"New York\"'\n",

    "Again, this is very clear. It selected Alice and Clara (who live in New York) and David (who is older than 30).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Advanced or Tricky Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The two \"killer features\" of `.query()` are using **backticks \\`\\`** for weird column names and using **`@`** to access local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4: Using backticks for columns with spaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_spaces = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'Full Name': ['Alice Smith', 'Bob Jones'],\n",
    "    'Age Level': [25, 30]\n",
    "})\n",
    "print(\"--- 1. Original (with spaces in names) ---\")\n",
    "print(df_spaces)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This would fail: df.query('Full Name == \"Alice Smith\"')\n",
    "# You MUST use backticks ``\n",
    "\n",
    "df_filtered = df_spaces.query('`Full Name` == \"Alice Smith\"')\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- 2. Filtered with backticks ---\")\n",
    "print(df_filtered)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- 1. Original (with spaces in names) ---\n",
    "       Full Name  Age Level\n",
    "0  Alice Smith         25\n",
    "1    Bob Jones         30\n",
    "\n",
    "--- 2. Filtered with backticks ---\n",
    "       Full Name  Age Level\n",
    "0  Alice Smith         25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Because the column `Full Name` has a space, standard Python syntax would break. `.query()` lets you \"escape\" this by wrapping the column name in backticks: \\``Full Name`\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 5: Using `@` to reference a Python variable**\n",
    "This is *extremely* useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A variable from our code\n",
    "min_age = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"\\n--- 3. Our local variable: min_age = {min_age} ---\")\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- 3. Our local variable: min_age = 30 ---\n",
    "\n",
    "--- 4. Filtered using the @variable ---\n",
    "    Name  Age     City\n",
    "3  David   35  Chicago\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The `@` symbol told `.query()` to \"look outside\" for a Python variable named `min_age` and substitute its value (30) into the query. This is much cleaner than `df[df['Age'] > min_age]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\\. Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're running a report and the parameters (like region, min sales) are stored in variables. `.query()` is perfect for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 6: Building a dynamic query**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parameters for our report\n",
    "target_city = 'New York'\n",
    "min_age = 25\n",
    "max_age = 40\n",
    "\n",

    "0  Alice   25  New York\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "We built a complex query string using three different local variables. This makes the code very easy to read and maintain. If the parameters change, we don't have to rewrite the `&` and `|` logic; we just change the variables.\n",

    "# Advanced filtering  second subtopic: `.isin()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.isin()` method is a specialized and highly efficient filter. It checks for **membership**, letting you select rows where a column's value *is in* a list of allowed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as checking IDs at a party. You have a \"guest list\" (your list of values), and `.isin()` is the bouncer. It goes down your DataFrame, row by row, and asks, \"Is your 'City' on this list?\" If `True`, the row gets in. If `False`, it's filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works in Memory**: `.isin()` is highly optimized. When you pass it a list `L`, it first converts `L` into a **hash set** (which is like a high-speed dictionary-key lookup). This makes checking for membership an incredibly fast, O(1) operation on average. It then iterates through your column (`df['City']`) and, for each city, it does a near-instant lookup in that hash set. This is *much faster* than chaining `|` (OR) operations, especially if your list of allowed values is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You *must* use this whenever you need to filter a column against a **list of multiple values**.\n",
    "  * **Good:** \"Find all sales from 'New York', 'Chicago', or 'San Francisco'.\"\n",
    "  * **Bad:** `(df['City'] == 'New York') | (df['City'] == 'Chicago') | (df['City'] == 'San Francisco')`. This is slow, hard to read, and error-prone.\n",

    "### 5\\. Common Mistakes / Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake 8: Passing a single string**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Wrong code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # You passed a string, not a list\n",
    "    df[df['City'].isin('New York')]\n",
    "except TypeError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"\\n--- Mistake 1: Passing a string ---\")\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error/Wrong Output:**\n",
    "`TypeError: 'str' object is not iterable`\n",
    "**Why it happens:** `.isin()` expects an *iterable* (like a list or set) that it can loop over to build its hash set. A single string is not a list.\n",
    "**Example 9: Corrected code:**\n",
    "You *must* wrap it in a list, even if there's only one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Correct code\n",
    "df_correct = df[df['City'].isin(['New York'])]\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- Corrected ---\")\n",
    "print(df_correct)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake 10: Using `.isin()` to check a single value**\n",
    "This isn't an error, but it's bad practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad, but works\n",
    "df_bad = df[df['City'].isin(['New York'])]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good, much faster and cleaner\n",
    "df_good = df[df['City'] == 'New York']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it happens:** `.isin(['New York'])` works, but it has the overhead of building a hash set for just one item. The simple `==` (equals) operator is much more direct and optimized for this case. Use `==` for one value; use `.isin()` for *two or more* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6\\. Key Terms (Explained Simply)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Boolean Mask:** A Series of `True`/`False` values used to select rows. `.isin()` creates one, and `.query()` uses one internally.\n",
    "  * **`.query()`:** A DataFrame method that filters rows using a **string expression** (e.g., `'Age > 30'`).\n",
    "  * **Expression (expr):** The string passed to `.query()` that contains the filtering logic.\n",
    "  * **`@variable`:** The syntax used inside a `.query()` string to reference a local Python variable (e.g., `df.query('Age > @min_age')`).\n",
    "  * **Backticks (\\`\\`)**: Used in a `.query()` string to wrap column names that have spaces or special characters (e.g., \\`'Sales (USD)'\\` \\> 100).\n",
    "  * **`.isin()`:** A **Series** method (called on a column) that filters based on **membership in a list**.\n",
    "  * **Membership:** Checking if a value is \"in\" a collection of other values (e.g., `'New York'` is in `['New York', 'Boston']`).\n",
    "  * **Hash Set:** The fast, O(1) lookup structure that `.isin()` uses internally to check for membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7\\. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **For `.query()`:**\n",
    "      * Use it when you have **multiple conditions**. `df.query('A > B and C < D')` is often cleaner than `df[(df['A'] > df['B']) & (df['C'] < df['D'])]`.\n",
    "      * Use the `@` prefix to **reference external variables** (`@my_var`). It's clean and safe.\n",
    "      * **Always** use backticks \\`\\` around column names with spaces or special characters.\n",
    "      * Use `and`, `or`, `not` inside the query string (not `&`, `|`, `~`).\n",
    "  * **For `.isin()`:**\n",
    "      * Use it *any time* you need to check if a column's value is one of **two or more** items in a list.\n",
    "      * For a *single* item, `df[df['City'] == 'New York']` is faster and clearer than `df[df['City'].isin(['New York'])]`.\n",
    "      * To filter for what's *not* in the list, combine it with `~`: `df[~df['City'].isin(my_list)]`.\n",
    "      * Store your \"allowed values\" in a **list** or **set** variable first, then pass the variable to `.isin()`. It's cleaner: `allowed_cities = [...]`, `df[df['City'].isin(allowed_cities)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8\\. Mini Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Boolean Indexing (`[]`, `&`, `|`)**: The fundamental, most common way to filter. Best for simple filters.\n",
    "  * **`.query()`**: A \"shortcut\" that uses a **string** to filter. Excellent for readability with multiple `and`/`or` conditions and for using local variables (`@my_var`).\n",
    "  * **`.isin()`**: A **Series** method used *inside* a filter. It's the best way to check for membership in a list (e.g., \"City is in `['NY', 'LA', 'SF']`\").\n",

    "### 13\\. Common Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **When would you use `.query()` instead of standard boolean indexing?**\n",
    "      * When I have multiple (`and`/`or`) conditions, as `.query()` is often more readable (e.g., `'A > B and C < D'`).\n",
    "      * When I need to use local Python variables in my filter, as the `@variable` syntax is very clean.\n",
    "2.  **What is the main advantage of `.isin()`?**\n",
    "      * Performance and readability. It's *much faster* than chaining `|` (OR) conditions. `df[df['ID'].isin(list_of_100_ids)]` is thousands of times faster than 100 `|` (OR) statements.\n",
    "3.  **My `.query()` is failing, but my column name `Sales (USD)` seems correct. Why?**\n",
    "      * The column name has spaces and parentheses. You *must* wrap it in backticks \\`\\` inside the query string. The correct query is `df.query('\\`Sales (USD)\\` \\> 1000')\\`.\n",
    "4.  **How do you select rows where 'City' is *not* in a list `['A', 'B']`?**\n",
    "      * You use the `~` (NOT) operator in front of the `.isin()` mask: `bad_cities = ['A', 'B']`, `df[~df['City'].isin(bad_cities)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14\\. Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`.isin()`:**\n",
    "      * **Time Complexity:** Very fast. **O(n + k)**, where 'n' is the length of your DataFrame's column and 'k' is the length of your \"allowed\" list. It builds a hash set (O(k)) and then does an O(1) lookup for each of the 'n' rows.\n",
    "      * **This is *vastly* superior** to chaining `|` (OR) statements, which would be **O(n \\* k)**.\n",
    "  * **`.query()`:**\n",
    "      * **Time Complexity:** Generally **O(n)**.\n",
    "      * **Performance:** For simple queries, it's about the same speed as standard boolean indexing. For *very complex* queries (many `&` and `|`), it can be *faster* because it uses the `numexpr` engine, which optimizes the full expression and avoids creating multiple, large, intermediate boolean Series in memory.\n",
    "  * **Memory Usage:** Both `.isin()` and `.query()` (when used for filtering) will return a **copy** of the data, not a view.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15\\. When NOT to Use This\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **When NOT to use `.query()`:**\n",
    "      * Don't use it for simple, single-column selection (e.g., `df['Age']`).\n",
    "      * Don't use it if you are setting values based on a condition. **Always** use `df.loc[mask, 'col'] = value` for setting. While you *can* sometimes make `query` work, `loc` is the universally correct, unambiguous tool for the job.\n",
    "  * **When NOT to use `.isin()`:**\n",
    "      * **Don't use it for a single value.** `df[df['City'] == 'New York']` is clearer and more efficient than `df[df['City'].isin(['New York'])]`.\n",
    "      * **Don't pass it a single string.** `df['City'].isin('New York')` will error. You must pass a list: `df['City'].isin(['New York'])`."
